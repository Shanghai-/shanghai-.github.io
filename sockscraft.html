			<h1>Unofficial <span>Sockscraft 2</span> Modding Guide</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Sockscraft 2</em> is a subscribers-only Minecraft server run by streamer and game dev <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/socksbx">Socksbx.</a>
                It is a <strong>vanilla server,</strong> and does <strong>not</strong> require mods to play. However, many players choose to use client-side mods, which are 
                compatible with vanilla servers, to enhance their gameplay experience. This guide explains how to set up a modded Minecraft instance for use with 
                <em>Sockscraft 2.</em> It assumes no prior knowledge of modded Minecraft. If you're familiar with modding already and just want some mod recommendations,
                skip to <a href="#modsHeader">"Recommended Mods"</a> below.
            </p>
            <p>
                This guide was written by <span>ShanghaiOhMy</span>, and is in no way official. Feel free to message <span>Shanghai#5385</span> on Discord if you have any 
                questions or issues with these instructions, but please remember that I am not a server administrator or an official server representative in any way. 
            </p>
            <h2>Ethos</h2>
            <p>
                Because Sockscraft does not require players to use a standardized modpack, many players will not be using mods. You are expected to keep your mod choices
                and usage fair to other players so that everyone can have fun. Do not install mods that give you an unfair advantage over other players, such as xray mods.
                If engaging in PVP combat, do not use your mini-map to track the opposing player. While the mods used are client-side only, you should still consider how 
                your choices may impact other players. 
            </p>
            <h1>Setup</h1>
            <h2>Getting a Mod Manager</h2>
            <p>
                The first step to creating a modded client for <em>Sockscraft 2</em> is to get a mod manager. Mod managers (or simply "launchers") are programs that manage
                the creation of new minecraft instances and installation of mods for you. There are a number of launchers out there, but for this tutorial we will use
                <a href="https://download.curseforge.com/">CurseForge.</a> Some alternatives include <a href="https://gdevs.io/">GDLauncher</a> and 
                <a href="https://skmedix.pl/sklauncher">SKLauncher.</a>
            </p>
            <h2>Creating a New Instance</h2>
            <p>
                Once you have CurseForge installed and running, you will need to create a new Minecraft instance using the "Create Custom Profile" button at the top right
                of the application.
            </p>
            <img src="images/sockscraft/AddNewProfile.png" alt='A screenshot of CurseForge. The "Create Custom Profile" button in the top right is highlighted.'/>
            <p>
                You can name this instance whatever you want, and give it any picture you want to represent it in your profile list (I chose the 
                <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MZM8ggR.png">Sockscraft 2 title art</a>). Next, you <strong>must</strong> select <span>1.18.2</span> for the Minecraft Version.
                This is the version the server is running, and if our client doesn't match it, we won't be able to connect.
            </p>
            <h2>Choosing a Game Type</h2>
            <p>
                The next step in the custom profile dialogue asks you to choose between Forge, Fabric, and Vanilla for this profile. Vanilla is just unmodified Minecraft,
                which is not what we want for this task. Our choice is between <span>Forge</span> and <span>Fabric</span>. These are two different modding platforms
                that expose the workings of the game to developers in different ways. As a player, there is no functional difference between the two, though Fabric is
                generally regarded as more performant. The real difference is in the selection of available mods; because they are two different modding platforms, Forge
                and Fabric have different mods available. Many of the most popular mods maintain versions for both Fabric and Forge, but some newer or older mods may only
                support one or the other. If you have any specific mods in mind, now is a good time to check which platforms they support before you make this decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be using <span>Forge</span>. I chose Forge because it has been around for longer, which means it has accumulated
                more available mods than Fabric. Select "Forge" for the game type, and leave the Modloader Version at whatever default value CurseForge has given it.
            </p>
            <img src="images/sockscraft/ProfileSettings.png" alt="A screenshot of CurseForge's new profile dialogue. The Minecraft version is set to 1.18.2, and the Game Type is set to Forge."/>
            <h1>Installing Mods</h1>
            <p>
                You are now ready to add some mods to your new instance! Click on the Profile's image (not the "Play" button) to open its details view. Click the 
                "Add More Content" button to enter the mod search screen. From here you can search, sort, and filter CurseForge's database of Minecraft mods. Clicking on
                a mod entry will bring you to its details page, where you can see a description, screenshots, and more. If a mod looks interesting, just hit "install" and
                it will be added to your instance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Remember:</span> you won't be able to connect to the server if you install any mods that aren't client-side only. 
                If a mod adds new content to the game, it probably isn't usable without the server running it too. Check mod descriptions for an indication of whether they
                require a server component before installing.
            </p>
            <h1 id="modsHeader">Recommended Mods</h1>
            <p>
                The mods listed below are the ones that I personally am playing with. None of them are required, and you should feel free to add or remove mods as you see
                fit. I have broken my list into categories to make browsing easier.
            </p>
            <h2>Utility</h2>
            <p>
                These are simple utility mods that make small but important changes. Mostly quality of life improvements.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured">Configured:</a> Adds a mod configuration menu to the main menu of Minecraft.
                    This is much easier to browse than digging through .toml config files yourself, and often contains explanations of the individual config items
                    that may not be present in the config files themselves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mouse-tweaks">Mouse Tweaks:</a> A simple mod which improves the feel of click-and-drag 
                    interactions in item GUIs. I find this much more intuitive when I'm crafting things.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/client-tweaks">Client Tweaks:</a> Moves the music and master volume sliders to the top level 
                    of the pause menu. Also has some nice options for reducing accidental torch placements with offhand torches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controlling">Controlling:</a> Adds a search bar to the key bindings screen, along with
                    indicators for conflicting and unbound keys. Without a bunch of big content mods adding new keybinds, this is less important, but I still find
                    it useful to have around.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Mapping</h2>
            <p>
                Mini-maps, full-screen maps, and waypoints are all extremely useful in a large multiplayer server like Sockscraft. There are dozens of mods that provide
                these capabilities in various forms, but I recommend choosing one of the two most popular ones:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap">Xaero's Minimap</a> and 
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-world-map">Xaero's World Map</a>:
                    This is the pair of mods that I am currently using for my map + minimap. It is extremely similar to JourneyMap in features, but I prefer its minimap 
                    display a little more. Both mods allow you to set waypoints at any point in the world and share them with other players, which helps with navigation
                    around the many points of interest in the Sockscraft server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/journeymap">JourneyMap:</a> Although I am less enthusiastic about its minimap, JourneyMap's
                    waypoints are more fun to use. They appear in the world as large beacons and can be seen from very far away. It's an equally valid choice for a
                    mapping mod.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                Information
            </h2>
            <p>
                These mods help me spend more time in the game and less time on the Minecraft Wiki looking up how to craft a spyglass.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jade">Jade:</a> This mod adds a small element to the top center of the HUD which lists the name
                    and some metadata about whatever block or entity you are looking at. A staple of modpacks, it is extremely useful both for players who are not very 
                    familiar with all of the blocks in the game <em>and</em> veterans who want access to more detailed information at a glance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei">Just Enough Items (JEI):</a> A cornerstone of Minecraft modding since time immemorial. This
                    mod adds a list of every item in the game to the right side of the inventory/crafting screen, along with a search bar to help you find what you're
                    looking for. Left-clicking an item pops up a GUI with its crafting recipe, and right-clicking shows you recipes that use it. This can save a lot of
                    time that would otherwise be spent leafing through the in-game crafting book or googling how to craft something.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                Cosmetic
            </h2>
            <p>
                These mods make visual changes to the game rather than functional ones.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chat-heads">Chat Heads:</a> This mod shows player skins next to messages in chat! It's a very
                    cute way to personalize messages from other users a bit more, especially users who are RPing with character skins. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-player-models">Customizable Player Models:</a> This mod lets players create and share
                    fully custom models & textures for their players. It's extremely fun and expressive, but takes a lot of time to figure out & build something with.
                    <span>Even if you don't plan to make a model for yourself, it's still fun to have this mod installed so you can see other players' models!</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/effective-forge">Effective:</a> Adds water splashes when items/entities fall into water, as
                    well as mist particles at the bottoms of waterfalls. The ambient waterfall sounds that it adds were much too loud and seemed to never stop though,
                    so I would recommend turning those off in the sound menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-discord-rpc">Simple Discord RPC:</a> The most optional of optional mods. Adds support
                    for rich Discord integration into the pack. This is really meant for modpack developers to advertise their modpacks via Discord's "now playing"
                    feature, but I figured it was fun to have a way to show that you're playing Sockscraft specifically to other players in the Discord server. The
                    config that I created for this mod is available <a href="downloads/simple-rpc.toml" download>here.</a> To use the config, open the overflow menu next to 
                    "Play" on your Profile's details screen, then select "Open Folder" and drag the downloaded config into the "config" folder.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                Optimization
            </h2>
            <p>
                Coming soon. TL;DR you can use Optifine and it won't break things, but if your frames are already fine and you don't want to use shaders then don't bother.
                I also hear good things about Sodium, but I've never tried it myself.
            </p>
            Happy mining!<br/>
